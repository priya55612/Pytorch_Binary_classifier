Written in pytorch to implement a basic binary classifier for image classification. This code can work for multiclass as well by modifying the [num_classes](https://github.com/priya55612/Pytorch_Binary_classifier/blob/master/train_data.py#L50) in the train_data.py. Useful for beginners like a boilerplate code!

**Note:** PyTorch expects the data to be organized by folders with one folder for each class. Therefore, each class of images should be provided as a separate directory or folder in the [data_dir](https://github.com/priya55612/Pytorch_Binary_classifier/blob/master/train_data.py#L16) directory. 


Code implementation steps:

```python3 train_data.py```

```python3 test_data.py```
