Written in pytorch to implement a basic binary classifier for image classification. This code can work for multiclass as well by modifying the [num_classes](https://github.com/priya55612/Pytorch_Binary_classifier/blob/master/train_data.py#L50). Useful for beginners like a boilerplate code!


Code implementation steps:

```python3 train_data.py```

```python3 test_data.py```
